				<h3> b) 2 Hours </h3>
				<p> The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is an African crocodile, the largest freshwater predator in Africa, and may be considered the second largest extant reptile in the world, after the saltwater crocodile. Nile crocodiles normally dive for only a few minutes at a time, but can swim underwater for up to 30 minutes if threatened, and if they remain fully inactive they can hold their breath for up to 2 hours (which, as aforementioned, is due to the high levels of lactic acid in their blood).</p>

				<span class="users-answer"></span>
				<h3> a) 78 Feet </h3>
				<p> According to Guinness World Records, Garrett McNamara (towed by Andrew Cotton) surfed the tallest recorded wave in history at at an astounding 78 feet (23 meters) in 2011. The term ‘towed’ means that “the surfer is brought to the wave, enabling them to catch waves that would otherwise be too strong to be caught by paddling in.” McNamara's official record might not stand for long, others have been rumored to have surfed waves reaching a height of 100 feet, however until the rumors have been confirmed McNamara remains the champ. </p>

				<h3> a) True </h3>
				<p> Did you know there are more plastic flamingos in the USA than real ones? Plastic flamingos are widely considered to be the stereotypical example of lawn kitsch – the American’s answer to garden dwarfs. Designed in 1957 by Don Featherstone while working for Union Products, the pink flamingo has gone from a piece of Florida exotica to a symbol of trash culture. Featherstone sculpted his 3-D flamingos from clay, working from photos of the birds in National Geographic. </p>
